<h2>Quality Level</h2>
<p>Allows fine control of the performance of the improved time stretch algorithm, with the tradeoff of reduced sound quality. This control is only available when Stretch Mode is set to Transient Preserving.</p>
<p>With Quality Level at 100, all parts of the sound are processed. As the level decreases, the CPU demands of the algorithm are reduced, with an impact on sound quality. More specifically, lowering the quality slider will introduce a mild noise floor or phasing effect, as the algorithm skips over portions of the input sound spectrum to save on computation.</p>
<p>It is recommended to fine tune this parameter while watching the CPU % values in the Performance Monitor.</p>
<p>Default value: 100<br/>
Range: 0 to 100<br/></p>
