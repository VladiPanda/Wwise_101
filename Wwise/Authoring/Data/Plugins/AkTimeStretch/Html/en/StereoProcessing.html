<h2>Stereo Processing</h2>
<p>The method used for handling stereo inputs. This control is only available when Stretch Mode is set to Transient Preserving.</p>
<p>The following options are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Left Right</strong>: Stereo inputs are handled normally.</li>
<li><strong>Center Cut</strong>: Stereo inputs are split into left, center, and right components before time stretching is applied. They are then reconstructed as left and right channels. Center Cut processing is only applied to stereo (2 channel) inputs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the Transient Preserving time stretch mode has a greater effect on the phase of the sound than the Classic stretch mode, the Center Cut option is provided as a way to better preserve complex stereo mixes.</p>
<p>Default value: Left Right<br/></p>
