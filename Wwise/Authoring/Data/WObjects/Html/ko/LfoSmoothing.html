<h2>Smoothing</h2>
<p>파형에 Low-pass filter를 적용하여 날카로운 끝을 평활화합니다.</p>
<p>This parameter can reduce output gain depending on your configuration. For a square waveform with an LFO of 1 Hz, gain reduction can be observed with a smoothing value as low as 30%. The higher the LFO frequency, the lower the smoothing value for which gain reduction is observed (for example, 2 Hz = 25%, 4 Hz = 20%, 8 Hz = 10%). For triangular or sawtooth waveforms, gain reduction can be observed with a smoothing value as low as 10%.</p>
