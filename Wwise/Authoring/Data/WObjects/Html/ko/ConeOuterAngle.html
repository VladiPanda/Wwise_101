<h2>Cone outer angle</h2>
<p>The angle that defines the area where Volume, Low-Pass Filter, Spread, and Focus Attenuation remain at their maximum levels.</p>
<p>The Cone outer angle defines the bottom boundary in the Cone Preview. It is redrawn in real time as the value is modified.</p>
<p>내부 및 외부 각도 사이의 영역은 과도 영역(transition area)이라 불립니다. The volume attenuation within this area is linearly interpolated between zero attenuation and the Cone max attenuation value.</p>
