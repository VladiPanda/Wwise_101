<h2>Cone inner angle</h2>
<p>The angle that defines an area where no attenuation occurs.</p>
<p>The Cone inner angle defines the top boundary in the Cone Preview. It is redrawn in real time as the value is modified.</p>
<p>The area between the inner and outer angle is called the transition area. The volume attenuation within this area is linearly interpolated between zero attenuation and the Cone max attenuation value.</p>
<p>Default value: 90<br/>
Range: 0 to 360<br/>
Units: Â° <br/></p>
