<h2>3D Position</h2>
<p>Defines how positions are calculated for the purpose of 3D positioning (attenuation and spatialization).</p>
<ul>
<li>Emitter: Positioning defined by the game.</li>
<li>Emitter + Automation: User-Defined position automation around the emitter game object. Edited using the <strong>Automation</strong> button.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Wwise Spatial Audio features are limited for sounds that use Emitter + Automation. Diffraction and Transmission processing is disabled for sounds that use Emitter + Automation. Furthermore, the automation offset does not apply to early reflection processing. Reflections are calculated using the base Game Object position.</p>
<ul>
<li>Listener + Automation: User-Defined position automation around listener game object. Edited using the <strong>Automation</strong> button.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Wwise Spatial Audio features are disabled for sounds that use Listener + Automation. This includes early reflection processing, Distance Probe, diffraction and transmission, and room sends.</p>
<p>Default value: Emitter<br/></p>
