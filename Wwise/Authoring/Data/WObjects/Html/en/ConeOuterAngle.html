<h2>Cone outer angle</h2>
<p>The angle that defines the area where Volume, Low-Pass Filter, Spread, and Focus Attenuation remain at their maximum levels.</p>
<p>The Cone outer angle defines the bottom boundary in the Cone Preview. It is redrawn in real time as the value is modified.</p>
<p>The area between the inner and outer angle is called the transition area. The volume attenuation within this area is linearly interpolated between zero attenuation and the Cone max attenuation value.</p>
<p>Default value: 245<br/>
Range: 0 to 360<br/>
Units: Â° <br/></p>
