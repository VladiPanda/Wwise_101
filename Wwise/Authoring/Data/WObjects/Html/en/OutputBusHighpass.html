<h2>High-pass Filter (to Output Bus)</h2>
<p>A High-Pass Filter for the signal routed to the audio output bus.</p>
<p>A recursive filter that attenuates low frequencies based on the value specified.</p>
<p>The units for this filter represent the percentage of High-Pass Filtering that has been applied, where 0 means no High-Pass Filtering (signal unaffected) and 100 means maximal attenuation.</p>

<p>Default value: 0<br/>
Range: 0 to 100<br/>
