<h2>Lookahead Time</h2>
<p>The amount of time reserved by the sound engine to seek the streaming data. This time defines the latency of the track. If the look ahead time is 100 milliseconds, the music will be heard only 100 milliseconds after pressing play.</p>
<p>If the look-ahead time is too small, audio tracks might become unsynchronized during playback.</p>
<p>Units: ms <br/></p>
