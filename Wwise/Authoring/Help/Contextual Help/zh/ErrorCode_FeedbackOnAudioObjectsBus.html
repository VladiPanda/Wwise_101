Feedback connections for Audio Objects buses are not suppported. Therefore, we recommend that you change the bus configuration to one that performs a mixdown of its input connections, such as "Same as Main Mix" or a specific speaker configuration. Alternatively, if the feedback connection was not the result of a complex audio propagation or spatial audio setup, you can try to avoid the situation that created the feedback connection. Feedback connections usually occur due to certain emitter-listener relationships creating cycles in the voice graph.</p></div></body></html>
