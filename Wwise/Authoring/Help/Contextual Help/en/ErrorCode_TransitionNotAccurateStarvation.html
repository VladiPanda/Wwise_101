This can only happen if the second sound is set as "Streamed" from disk. Such transitions can exist in Random/Sequence Containers, in Interactive Music, and when using the Dynamic Sequence mechanism in code. This should be preceded by a Source Starvation error. The sound will be stopped.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><p class="title"><b>Recommended resolution steps:</b></p><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Use the <a class="link" href="">Zero Latency</a> mechanism on the second sound.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Don't use Streaming for the second sound and place it in a SoundBank.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Investigate if there was simply too much streaming from disk at that moment, from Wwise or from other modules in the game.
