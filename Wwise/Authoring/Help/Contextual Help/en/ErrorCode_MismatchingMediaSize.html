It indicates that Wwise has detected that the WEM file isn't the same size as when the SoundBank(s) referring to it were generated. This usually points to a problem in the generation, packaging, or deployment of SoundBanks and WEM files. This process is normally handled by the game engine.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><p class="title"><b>Probable causes:</b></p><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>An error in the packaging or deployment of the SoundBank and WEM files in the game.
