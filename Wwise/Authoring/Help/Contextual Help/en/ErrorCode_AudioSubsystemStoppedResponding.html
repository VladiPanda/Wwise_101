This usually mean the audio driver crashed, reconfigured, or reset on its own without notifying the sound engine or the application. The engine is put in a safe mode where no audio device is selected. The audio events are still processed so the synchronization with the game is not lost.</p><p>Normally, this error will resolve itself when the system's audio driver restarts.</p><p>On some systems, such as iOS and Android phones, this error could occur upon receiving a system interruption for a phone call, for example. Audio should normally resume after the interruption.</p></div></body></html>
