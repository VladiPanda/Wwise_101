This is because too many discrete 3D Audio Objects are already playing.</p><p>
          3D audio systems that support discrete objects generally limit how many can play concurrently. For example, Windows Sonic for Headphones on Windows 10 can support up to 112 individual 3D objects 
          (refer to Microsoft's <a class="link" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/coreaudio/spatial-sound" target="_blank">Spatial Sound documentation</a> for details).
        </p><p>Every new voice exceeding this limit will issue this error in the Capture Log.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><p class="title"><b>Recommended resolution steps:</b></p><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>If you didn't intend for this voice to be positioned in 3D space, change its 3D Spatialization property to <span class="bold"><strong>None</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              If you didn't intend for this voice to be sent as a discrete object, and simply want to suppress the error message, route the sound through a mixing bus. 
              Alternatively, if you are constrained by your mixing hierarchy, you can attach a Wwise System Output Settings Metadata ShareSet to the sound and set the <span class="bold"><strong>Mix Behavior</strong></span> property to <span class="bold"><strong>Mix to main</strong></span>.

              If you would rather opt out of using a system's discrete 3D audio objects capabilities when it doesn't support a certain number of objects,
              increase the value of the <span class="bold"><strong>System Minimum Object Requirement</strong></span> property of the System ShareSet used by the master bus.
              Note that this can be done on a per-platform basis as well.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              To opt out of discrete 3D Audio Objects entirely, deselect the <span class="bold"><strong>Enable Objects</strong></span> property of the System ShareSet used by the master bus.
